Software and Developement,"I'm back, with a very interesting topic too!

Joel Spolsky, ex-Microsoft Manager and software engineering guru has a new essay,  How Microsoft Lost the API War  that is creating quite a big storm in the blogging communitiy.

Joel posits that the priests in the holy Temple of Microsoft have lost their way, because it has split into two factions, and the wrong faction is winning. One faction worships on the alter of backward compatibility, while the other is led by fervent priests who are proselytizing to raise up the new gods of .NET and Longhorn. Joel suggests that the new gods will cause the destruction of the holy Temple because Microsoft's great victories were built on the altar of keeping customers happy with backward compatibility. Furthermore the old gods of the Windows API continue to grow more grotesque and cruel with the passing of time, driving former worshipers into the arms of the friendlier gods of World Wide Web.

This story sounds extremely plausible. I must admit that i fit the profile of the developer who used to develop on the Window's API, is familiar with COM and Win32 who now develops mostly using PHP and Python. However I continue to develop and maintain Windows apps that keep our customers happy, and we still plan to develop new Windows apps. Some points:

Temple of the Blind?
Firstly, Microsoft is still a compelling place to work for to people who feel that they can make a difference. The Temple continues to attract talented people with a Unix background. For example we have the recent hiring of Ward Cunningham, author of the Wiki.  Microsoft is still able to keep talented people like Raymond Chen, and others like him who continue to look after the Windows API, and Longhorn apparently will still give high priority to backward compatibility.  Open sourcerers  like Miguel Icaza are sufficiently attracted to the .NET vision to stake their careers on Mono. Longhorn and .NET are compelling technologies, so even if Win32 is not so cute anymore, M'soft is providing something that remains very attractive.

What i do see M'soft doing wrong is that they aren't disseminating the .NET runtime fast enough. It remains an optional install in XP Service Pack 2 for example. Also their IE dev team appears to be hog-tied due to political reasons; nevertheless IE remains good enough, particularly when I can embed IE as an activeX control, something I cannot do with Mozilla (AFAIK) - Update: I'm  wrong .

Temple of the Spider?

Secondly, people don't merely use a web browser. They run the web browser in the OS.  So let me ask you, if you are using DreamWeaver or HomeSite or Photoshop or vi or emacs or Gimp, how many of you are willing to give it up for a java applet (or whatever your favorite technology is) running in your web-browser? Precisely.

Temple of the Abandoned?

Third, Joel makes the claim that developers are not developing to the Windows API. Well he could be right. But I bet a lot of them are still calling Win32.  If you are using a framework or IDE like Delphi or wxWindows (or .NET or VB) then you certainly are insulated from the Windows API, but that doesn't mean that you're not calling the Windows API all the time. I don't see Borland dropping their Windows version of Delphi at any point in time.

In fact, the fact that many developers are using some form of framework is a compelling argument for Microsoft to enhance the .NET framework to attract developers who are using other frameworks.

Today, not that many students learn x86 assembler, but that doesn't mean that Intel lost the CPU wars. Just because fewer people are learning Win32 doesn't mean Microsoft has lost the API wars, if the frameworks  run predominantly on Win32 .

Temple of the Lost

Joel even warns you in the beginning that "" because I'm talking about big trends, I need to exaggerate and generalize "". But you still get sucked in because Joel Spolsky is a first-class writer, in the same order as Philip Greenspun or Eric Raymond. That makes him so persuasive and plausible. But this is not Indiana Jones and doomed temples, but Steve Jobs and reality distortion fields.

Other opinions:
Harry Fuecks  (PHP is ASP's upgrade path),
Dennis Hamilton  (M'soft is just covering all bases),
Robert McLaws  (Joel is wrong in 7 points),  Oliver Travers  (the web is not good enough),  One Run-time to Rule them all... ."
Software and Developement,"The most painful kind of generosity are the promises you cannot fulfill. The people who were once so grateful then turn on you, and your self-esteem is sure to take a beating.

Many years ago, in a fit of generosity, Dave Winer offered to host all early-bird adopters of editthispage.com free hosting of their weblogs. This included php.weblogs.com.
Well Dave Winer recently announced that he was closing down the weblogs.com and editthispage.com websites. He no longer runs a company that can support these sites and they are a personal and financial strain on him.

I was disappointed, but I had no expectations that Dave would do this in perpetuity.  My momma taught me to keep my expectations low when it comes to free things. After all, Dave and I have never met, and I've only exchanged a couple of emails with him.

I had a feeling that something like this was going to happen because the site has suffering from poor performance this past month. So my contingency plan was to ship the weblog to a commercial hosting service like weblogger if need be. During the weekend, just before the site was cut off, and before any announcement by Dave, I moved my most important open source project to sourceforge, to http://adodb.sourceforge.net/.

Today I got an email from Lawrence, Userland's webmaster:

Subject:   php.weblogs.com
From:      ""Lawrence Lee"" deleted#userland.com
Date:      Wed, June 16, 2004 1:46 am
To:        jlim#natsoft.com
Priority:  Normal
Mailer:    Microsoft Office Outlook, Build 11.0.5510

We'll be continuing to host php.weblogs.com, we made special arrangements
with Dave to keep it running.

Lawrence


I didn't ask for special treatment, so this is a pleasant surprise. Apparently the people at Userland decided to host this weblog and Dave emailed me, saying he had nothing to do with this decision. Of course I don't expect this offer to be permanent either, and I will deal with that when the time comes. The website's performance is still terrible though, and I have no expectations about this either.

For those who ever wondered what the icon below each post means, it's a graphic emoticon of how i feel. I think the jazz singer Billie Holiday is an appropriate image for this post; her songs are always bitter-sweet. It sure feels like  Stormy Weather  or  Come Rain or Shine .

I would also like to thank those of you who emailed me privately about this issue. RSS seems the best
way to access this web-site at the moment, as it continues to go down at random times."
Software and Developement,"PDO is a new database API that will be part of the official PHP 5.1 release. AFAIK, PDO will not be a full-fledged database abstraction library, but will provide a standard database API for PHP.

Here is a sample taken from the PDO download:

0));
$stmt = $x->prepare(""select NAME, VALUE from test where value like ?"");
$the_name = 'bar%';
$stmt->execute(array($the_name)) or die(""failed to execute!"");
$stmt->bindColumn('VALUE', $value);

while ($row = $stmt->fetch()) {
echo ""name=$row[NAME] value=$row[VALUE]n"";
echo ""value is $valuen"";
echo ""n"";
}
echo ""Let's try an updaten""
$stmt = $x->prepare(""INSERT INTO test (NAME, VALUE) VALUES (:name, :value)"");
$stmt->bindParam("":name"", $the_name, PDO_PARAM_STR, 32);
$stmt->bindParam("":value"", $the_value, PDO_PARAM_STR, 32);
for ($i = 0; $i < 4; $i++) {
$the_name = ""foo"" . rand();
$the_value = ""bar"" . rand();
if (!$stmt->execute()) {
break;
}
}
echo ""All donen"";
?>

Highlights of PDO include the unified object-oriented API,  compiled statements are now first class objects (the PDOStatement class),  and better support for bind variables, which will give a substantial speed boost for performance freaks.

Does this make ADOdb superflous? If you are looking for something that just works with mysql, then ADOdb might not be for you.  However ADOdb still has a big role to play, because:

(1) ADOdb makes it easier to develop PHP apps that work with multiple databases, with portable handling of data types and schemas.

(2) PDO does not provide an infrastructure for enterprise database access, such as recordset caching, sql logging and tuning, and session management.

(3) If you come from a Windows background (like me), it is easy to learn ADOdb because it follows many M'soft conventions.

So the next question is, how to extend ADOdb to support PDO? I think we can retain the existing ADOdb infrastructure,  treating PDO as just another ADOdb driver. At the same time, we will add PDO specific extensions to the ADOdb PDO driver.

So the classic ADOdb calling conventions will still work:

include('adodb.inc.php');
$DB = NewADOConnection('pdo');
$DB->Connect($host, $user, $pwd, $db);
$rs = $DB->Execute(""select * from table where name=?"",array('Jill'));
while (!$rs->EOF) {
var_dump($rs->fields);
$rs->MoveNext();
}

And we will add a new ADOdb statement class to support PDO conventions:

include('adodb.inc.php');
$DB = NewADOConnection('pdo');
$DB->Connect($pdo_connection_string);
$stmt = $DB-> PrepareStmt (""select * from table where name=?"");
$stmt->Execute(array('Jill'));
while ($arr = $stmt->Fetch()) {
var_dump($arr);
}

Software and Developement,"Continuing my belief that the best way to learn the fine art of programming is to learn from your better looking neighbours, here's a very interesting article on using exceptions in Java that can be applied to PHP5.
Dr Kabutz (love the name), gives several excellent real-world examples of how hard it is to handle exceptions.

Of course there are exceptions to the exceptions. Don't use an exception when:

the error is not really an error, but a change of state, such an end-of-file condition. Confusing this point is the most common beginner mistake.
you want to write obfusticated code because your job has been made redundant :-)
the error is so difficult to fix that you have to write custom code at the point the error occurred.
you're still using PHP3, and planning to upgrade to PHP4 next year :-)
you are doing something mission-critical, and you want to enumerate and handle every possible error where it occurs, to ensure safety and timeliness.
your very  experienced  boss tells you that it's better to return an error code that is ignored than raise an exception that is ignored :-)

Software and Developement,"Keith Devens says:
It turns out it's much faster to build large strings from many smaller strings by concatenating them onto one string than it is to append to an array repeatedly and then join that array into a string. I timed it and was surprised by the results.

Software and Developement,"There's a debate on web services in the .NET world. Datasets are XML objects that contain recordset information. You can perform various operations on them (such as insert/delete/update) and they can be replicated back to the host database. Developers are using DataSets for data exchange in web services. MSDN has a  good article  on this. Is this a good idea?

Scott Hanselmann doesn't think so, in this post:  Returning DataSets from WebServices is the Spawn of Satan and Represents All That Is Truly Evil in the World . But  Barry Gervin  thinks it's ok.

I agree with Scott, it's a bad idea. Exposing internal details is usually a lousy idea for web services (or any API that has a public interface). It defeats the concepts of information hiding and easy interoperatability between heterogenous systems; it also provides info that is potentially useful for sql-injection attacks.

What do you think?"
Software and Developement,"You cannot help but like someone like Greg who is  honest and humble :

""I am one of the core developers of the PEAR package who has joined the game relatively late... The base PEAR class is one monstrous mistake, and PEAR_Error is pretty close. Everyone knows this. I designed an error class that is much, much more flexible and it is part of PEAR 1.3.1 (PEAR_ErrorStack) - check it out. ""

Sadly it's just not true that everyone knows that PEAR class is big mistake (Jeff Moore has more on  why PEAR.php is awful ).
Given that PEAR is both an important framework and a worthless class, the confusion in names will
definitely  cause the value of the PEAR class to be overestimated. Just read any article on PEAR and you can see what nice words they have to say about the base classes :-(

I once said once that too many PEAR developers were journeymen. This might have offended
some people, but I was trying hard to be diplomatic. I must say that today the PEAR group is definitely more mature, and they have learnt a lot about library design. What would really make my eyes light up
would be an PEAR2 initiative that kept the existing classes, but dropped the bad seeds such as PEAR.php (e.g. the PEAR and PEAR_Error classes).

And in case you were wondering, I do think there's great value in the PEAR DB API. API's are important for interoperatability. For example, ADOdb has a PEAR DB compatibility mode. I would certainly be flattered if PEAR DB had an ADOdb compat mode too :-)"

Software and Developement,"A little bit of cross-pollenization never hurt anyone. There's a lot to be learnt from .NET:

At the height of the dot-com boom in the mid-1990's, many companies burst onto the scene as Application Services Providers (ASPs) hoping to capitalize on the wave of Internet success stories, and rake in some loot. Aside from the unfortunate market collapse that followed, ASPs had other issues to deal with such as training staff to effectively build and manage a secure, reliable and highly available operation.

Today, Web-enabling architecture is prevalent, particularly since Web services have become a staple for most applications, and the growing pains of ASPs past are feeding businesses everywhere with a hunger for successful implementations for 24x7 applications. As Service-Oriented Architectures (SOA) themes spread across organizations, applications are now reaching wider audiences than ever before. Gone are the days where you can sling some code, ship product, and cross your fingers.


The key points that i see addressed in this article:

You need to be able to handle long-running jobs, and you can do that by storing the job in a queue to be handled later by a background process. In the PHP world, this can be implemented by storing a queue of jobs in a database table or shared memory. Then you have a background process monitoring this table for new jobs to run.

Distributed processing to spread the load. COM+ is discussed. In PHP, we could use XML-RPC or SOAP to work with a set of distributed servers.

And when you have distributed processing, you might need to synchronize distributed transactions. This is something that's difficult to implement in PHP, and it is probably best to structure your design to allow only a single master software to perform data synchronization, instead of allowing multiple masters.

For example, in the typical PHP-distributed MySQL scenario, you would have one single master database which you write to, and multiple read-only slave databases to which the changes are replicated to."

Read News in a tabfolder, save favorites in categories, Export to PDF / RTF / HTML / OPML, Import Feeds from OPML, perform fulltext-search, use internal browser.  The next version of RSSOwl is available. Finally, loading any number of feeds and aggregations is now running completly in the background allowing to open feeds while a loading is running. This not only removes the annoying ""Please wait..."" dialog, but also improves the performance when loading aggregations.  A comparison of time it takes loading the 130 sample favorites resulted in 14.5 seconds for RSSOwl 0.82b and 90.5 seconds for earlier versions.


Improved handling of protected newsfeeds. It is now possible to let RSSOwl remember username and password so that the user does not have to enter these information everytime the feed is loading.

A lot of bugs have been fixed. Thanks for the feedback!

See the changelog for a complete list of changes.

May the owl be with you,

Software and Developement,"The Atari 2600 Video Computer System (VCS), introduced in 1977, was the most popular home video game system of the early 1980's.  Stella is a multi-platform Atari 2600 VCS emulator.  It allows you to play all of your favorite Atari 2600 games again! This is the 1.4.1 release of Stella for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows.  Distributions for other operating systems will appear as they become available.


Stella was originally developed for Linux by Bradford W. Mott, however, it has been ported to a number of other
platforms.

The
distributions currently available are:

* Binary distribution in RPM format for Linux (stella-1.4.1-1.i586.rpm)

* Binary distribution for Mac OSX (StellaOSX1.4.1.dmg.gz)

* Binary distribution for Windows (stella-1.4.1-win32.zip)

* Source code distribution for Linux, Mac OSX and Windows (stella-1.4.1-src.tar.gz)

* Source code in SRPM format for Linux RPM-based systems (stella-1.4.1-1.src.rpm)

PLEASE DO NOT WRITE ASKING FOR ROM IMAGES TO USE WITH STELLA! ALL SUCH
REQUESTS WILL BE IGNORED!

New in this Release
===================

* Fixed PAL sound issues.  PAL games now should sound correct (no distortion
or missing sounds), but some games may still run too fast.  This is still
a work-in-progress, and will be fixed in Stella 1.5.

* Cleaned up the SDL event gathering loop.  This should hopefully fix the
problems with ""double-pumping events"" reported by some Windows users.
Event gathering and dispatching is now much faster as well.

* Fixed a bug where the Control or Alt keys could be assigned to some event,
but they could never be used.  Control/Alt can now be used for any event.

* Updated stella.pro file to work with the latest Good2600 ROMset release
(Thanks go to Voch for helping to maintain the stella.pro file).

* For the Windows port; removed requirement for ROM files to be named *.bin
in the StellaX frontend.  The ROM's can now have any name, but ZIP-files are
not yet supported.

* For the Windows port; fixed the problems with the included modified SDL
library and Windows 98 users.  Stella should now run in Windows 98.

* For the OSX port; added preference to allow user to select the directory
in which ROM images are stored.  This sets the default directory to start
the browsing for a ROM in, and doesn't preclude the user from selecting a
file outside that directory.

* For the OSX port; fixed preferences bug where Preferences changed before
a game was opened were not being saved."
Software and Developement,"OpenWFE is an open source java workflow engine. It is a complete Business Process Management suite, with 4 components : an engine, a worklist, a webclient and a reactor (host for automatic agents). It can also be used behind the scene. OpenWFE 1.4.1 is a bug fix release. One important concept was introduced for stores : the order in which they are instantiated in the worklist configuration file is now the order in which they are asked if they accept a workitem for a given participant name.


The first store to accept (by name pattern matching) a workitem 'wins' it.

The default store is not 'Store.default' anymore, it is now the last declared store. To follow this scheme, the example Store.default has been moved at the end of the release store declarations."
Software and Developement,"BIE (Business Integration Engine) is an Open Source data integration system for exchanging data with internal or external sources.

It competes in the same EAI space as applications like MicrosoftÂ® BizTalkÂ®, WebmethodsÂ®, and TibcoÂ®.


BIE 6.0.3 adds message Aggregation Actions based on the Combine and Gather integration patterns, Stylesheet export and compiler enhancements to the Map Builder, as well as stability and bug fixes.

Software and Developement,"phpwsBB is a native bulletin board module for the phpWebSite content manage system, version 0.9.3-4 or later.  It features thread monitoring and administration, including marking threads sticky, locking threads, and forking messages off to new threads.

For some reason I had made use of PHPWS_File::makeDir(), even though it doesn't exist in phpWebSite 0.9.3-3, just >= 0.9.3-4.  I didn't notice because the bug only makes itself known on fresh installs, not updates, where I didn't call that function, simply because I forgot to update the mkdir() call.

Anyway I'm now making full use of PHPWS_File::makeDir() and changed the system requirement to reflect this.  I've also pulled the 0.9.6 release to avoid further confusion.

Software and Developement,"Marathon 0.82 is released. This is a minor feature update and bug fix release. Marathon should work better on Linux now.
Marathon runs gui based acceptance tests against swing applications. It is composed of a runner, and recorder, and an editor. Tests scripts are expressed as python code."
Software and Developement,"After an annoyingly long series of beta releases, say hello to MediaWiki 1.3.0! Everyone running the beta releases is _strongly_ recommended to upgrade to the current code. MediaWiki is the collaborative editing software that runs Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia, and other projects. It's designed to handle a large number of users and pages without imposing too rigid a structure or workflow.


This release includes a security fix: the 1.3.0 beta releases may be vulnerable to a PHP inclusion attack if include files are exposed and you have allow_url_fopen and register_globals on (this is the default configuration in PHP 4.1.x, but register_globals is off by default in 4.2.x and later).

Note that while MediaWiki through 1.1 required register_globals to be on, 1.2 and 1.3 *do not*. If you have register_globals on, you should turn it off unless you are absolutely sure you require it for some other package. See http://php.net/register_globals for general information.

Software and Developement,"Don asks  what's the big deal. His point of view is interesting.
It's very true that Google has failed to keep up with the ""search engine optimization"" tricks that cause links to porn sites to show up on our Referers pages and blog post comments. As we've said here several times, and thought many more, Google is the place where this practice should be stopped. It's because of Google that our sites are littered with links to these offensive sites that have  nothing to do  with ours. If they're smart enough to come up with tricks like Google News and Local Google, why can't their search engine recognize comment and referer spam and not use it in determining page rank? Of course they can. Why don't they? I'd love to hear an explanation.
Maybe secretly Google really doesn't like blogs. Maybe it's not so secret. They still haven't deigned to support the standard format for syndication, as every other tech company and major publisher has. Why Google has a stake in breaking the standard is another puzzle. And how does this relate to Don't Be Evil. We've asked this question a few times, only to be met with the usual stone wall.
This is not a public company but they have public stock now. And while they think they're real special, like Don Park, I'm not so sure they are. I made $800 on my Google stock yesterday, that paid for my hotel and gas and then some. But I'm paying for their deafness in other, imho more important ways. This is a company that desperately needs some competition, and I hope they rise to it, instead of folding, as the previous Silicon Valley wunderkind (with the same backers) did."
Software and Developement,"Every night on this trip I wake up at approx 2AM. I have no idea why. I get up for a couple of hours, do some writing, or programming, then go back to sleep. I can't recall this happening before. Maybe it's because I'm drinking more coffee than usual? Not sure. Anyway, I'm up, and writing.
I heard a report on NPR yesterday as I was leaving Harrisonburg about the seige in Najaf in Iraq, and how it's a lot more serious than most reports indicate. They interviewed a Washington Post reporter who was embedded with the US troops there. Defying Sean Hannity and his flock who think I should turn my mind off (no I'm not a liberal), this makes sense.
The Imam Ali shrine at Najaf is one of the most meaningful places in Islam. We don't have anything remotely like it in the US, because our culture is so young. This place is like Yankee Stadium to a Yankees fan, or Disneyland to a Disney fanatic. And this doesn't begin to explain the value to Muslims of the shrine we're talking about. It's like one of the historic Jewish or Christian places in Israel.
How much of an imagination does it take to see the parallels, to realize we're messing with things we don't understand. How would we feel if a Muslim army were occupying the US Capitol or even the Superdome? It would be the top item on CNN and Fox until the seige was over.
In science fiction, even very bad science fiction, they teach you how to take what you know about one set of circumstances and apply it to another. To see why this is such a mess, all you have to do is apply the sci fi mindset. How would you feel if there was an Islamic army driving down every main street in every town in America? I wouldn't like it, and I bet you wouldn't either."
Software and Developement,"This is a piece I've been working up to for quite some time, and it'll probably be an audio blog post at some time soon.
I have five really good friends in the world. When I realized that, saying that to one of them, she said that's pretty damned good and I agree. These are people who I trust with knowing anything and everything about me. People who could call me if they needed help. I would drop everything to be there for them, and vice versa. But none of these people have weblogs, and if they had them, I wouldn't point to them, because (key point) then I would lose the ability to be friends with them.
This came home to me talking with Len Apcar at the NY Times just before the DNC. In a wide-ranging discussion I said that I had given up on the idea of friendship in the blogosphere. Apcar said that now I understood something about how they approach news. You can't be friends with the people you cover. Or you can't cover people who are friends. Either way it's equally true.
Okay, enough preamble. Ed Cone is a person I admire, I think he could be a good friend, I'm sure he is to his friends, no doubt there, but key point, he and I are not friends. That means I can point to him (which I do) and write about his work (which I've not done recently) without fear of turning this weblog into nothing more than a way of scratching the itches of my friends.
Ninety-nine percent of the blogs you read are just that, friendship favor-trading. Not this one. I will tell you when I think someone is fucking up. They will think I am not being their friend, and they will be right. But when I say  something  is good, or someone is not fucking up, you can trust that I'm saying that because I believe it to be true."

Software and Developement,"BIE (Business Integration Engine) is an Open Source data integration system for exchanging data with internal or external sources. Built in Java, this platform-independent integration system includes a web-based management and configuration GUI, a drag-and-drop Map Builder and a wide variety of built in protocols, message formatters and listeners. It competes in the same EAI space as applications like MicrosoftÂ® BizTalkÂ®, WebmethodsÂ®, and TibcoÂ®. BIE 6.0.3 adds bug fixes for Map Builder macros and stability.

Software and Developement,"Gallery v1.4.4-pl1 is an update to Gallery 1.4.4 to resolve several issues found after the release. Most of these issues are fairly minor, and the one security issue fixed in this release requires a fairly unusual Gallery configuration and a bit of effort to exploit.  This is still a recommended upgrade due to the bug fixes, but if you want to keep your Gallery secure without a full upgrade, a small patch to fix that issue is available separately. Gallery is a slick, intuitive web based photo gallery with authenticated users and privileged albums. Easy to install, configure and use. Photo management includes automatic thumbnails, resizing, rotation, etc. User privileges make this great for communities.

Software and Developement,"This release is primarily a bugfix release that contains some rather critical bugfixes which affect Windows and 64-bit platforms. giFT is a project designed to completely abstract low-level filesharing protocol communication while allowing seamless support for multiple networks. Currently available plugins include: OpenFT, Gnutella, and FastTrack (third party).




Critical changes:

giftd 0.11.7:

* Filter LOCATE requests so that they are not delivered to protocol plugins which do not have a registered hash handler for the hash type being searched for.

* Preserve extension when renaming downloaded files because the file name is already used.

* Removed requirement for state files having leading dot on Windows.

* Fixed bug which prevented completed dir from being shared if no sharing root was set.

* Added meta data extraction for bittorrent files.

* Added check to not share incoming dir if not specifically allowed by config.

* Fixed some bugs which could lead to shares db corruption.

* Added saving of download paused state across restarts.

libgift 0.11.7:

* Fixed VA_COPY bug in strobj which led to crashes on AMD64 (possibly other platforms?)

* Fixed fd leak in platform_child() implementation.

* Fixed a bug where we possibly send SIGTERM to random processes in platform_cleanup()."

Software and Developement,"When determining your best back-up routine, consider the amount of data being backed up, the best medium for your situation, how long each part of the network can be done and more."
Software and Developement,"This morning I make my exit from Florida, for now.
This type of travel, a long road trip with lots of stops, means lots of arrivals and departures, because at this stage in life I have lots of places I can go where there are friends, aquaintances, and especially in the case of Florida, memories -- to first say hello to, then goodbye.
I used to come here when I was a college and grad student, but when I moved to California warm weather wasn't such a novelty, and Florida seemed so far away, so small. I didn't come back again until just a couple of years ago on a road trip through the state from Miami to St Augustine and back with Uncle Vava, one in which we luckily took a tour of his property east of Crescent Beach on the Intercoastal. Some part of me sensed this would be the last time, and that I would visit next after his demise, a premonition that came true far too soon.
Yesterday I got a check for most of my share of his estate and I looked at real estate. This part of Florida, for all the growth, and the growth has been enormous, is still very reasonable. A nice three bedroom, two bath house can be bought for less than $300,000; easy walking distance from the beach, most amenities (most houses don't have pools, and none have hot tubs).
The sense I get from this trip is that people are so temporary but the things we build last much longer. When I was a kid, I didn't understand how such big things as a beach front condo complex can get built, but now I do. The people who make the finance decisions don't understand life any better than I do, they just have been taught a formula for what makes a good investment, and what doesn't, and the formula is tried and true, it expresses something mathematical about the nature of our species, as a community, and it's stood the test of time. I've learned it first on a relatively large scale, in California real estate, and now in a much more manageable size, Florida real estate. I've learned that I could afford an equally lovely slice of Planet Earth here, now, for much less money than my slice of California cost in 1992. And as a bonus there's a very swimmable beach nearby.
The tradeoff of course is that there aren't very many Internet heavy weights nearby, but maybe that's a blessing, and for the money I save, I could buy my own T1 line and be as close as you can get to them anyway. "";->""
Part of me is tempted to write the check for a down payment and call the movers in San Jose and have all my stuff brought here out of storage. But I'm going to resist the temptation, for now at least, and drive north and west, but mostly north. My next stop, Murphy-willing, and assuming a last-minute gig to cover the RNC in NYC doesn't materialize, is Madison, Wisconsin, and then over the Canadian Rockies, a passage I've never before made and one I totally look forward to, ending in Seattle by Labor Day for Bumbershoot."
Software and Developement,"Meanwhile back in California, they're paving paradise and putting up a parking lot. (With  thanks  to Joni Mitchell.)
Everywhere you look the blogosphere is being hitched to business models, none of them very creative, nothing more than rehashes of what was tried in the 90s, and in some cases worked, but in no cases yielded anything that behaved like a weblog.
The only reason to publish a weblog, imho, is if you have a passion for something and want to make sure people hear what you have to say about it. You have to be pro-flow, anything that restricts flow is un-blog-like, and will yield a newspaper, a magazine, a professional publication, something very different from a blog. (Sure there are also the personal diaries, which are mostly ways of saying Hey I'm Here, and I'm not sure my model for a blog is much different, so nothing is very simple, or hard and fast.)
I suppose it was inevitable, and I guess it's okay. I just find that I'm repelled by the idea of raising multiple millions of dollars for a business where the tools can be had so cheaply. What are you going to charge for? Hmmm. I think I shouldn't have to pay for that.
Anyway, I keep getting requests to link to some silly things, like sites taking their content out of their RSS feed. When this happens it sends a chill deep into my body, a sense that this is what was wrong with Silicon Valley in the 80s and 90s, but it wasn't so easy to see as it is now. Weblogs started out, I thought, as a fun project to push neat ideas into the world, but maybe it was always supposed to be a news magazine that made money. No matter, I don't think very many who read blogs in RSS will change and start reading them on the Web so we can see the ads. As usual, that's a benefit for the publisher, not for me. I understand why they want me to do it, but have they given me any reason to do it? It's really hard to explain how this works. I like these blogs, I admire them, I consider myself a founder in some way. I didn't expect them to think of me as eyeballs, and I'm depressed to find out that they do. Maybe I'm reading this wrong. Hope so.
I have a mind, I also have eyeballs, but I'd prefer if you think of me as a mind."

Software and Developement,"It gets hot here early, so I've been taking my daily walks earlier and earlier. Today I was up before dawn and thought this must be the best time of all to walk. Turns out that was totally true.
When I left it was dark. I got onto the beach, and while I could see in front of my feet, I couldn't make out the houses that line the beach. As I walked, it got lighter, and now I could make out two people walking from a house to the water, about a two-block walk, the beach is very wide.
Then more light, revealing people everywhere! It seems I'm not the only person with this idea (why do we always think we're the only smart ones). I walk and walk. Oh man.
I thought to bring my camera, so you can experience this too. This time I deliberately took some movies. Here are three. 1. Some  birds  wading in the tide; 2. A man on a  bicycle  and 3. A bit of  surf  and nothing more. (There is an annoying click on the audio, not sure what it comes from, I was holding the camera quietly, or so I thought.)
And then here are some stills . I shot them at double resolution, but the HTML image elements reduce them in size. I don't have the patience to store two versions of the pictures, so if you're bandwidth-constrained don't click on the link, and if you already did, I apologize.
Right now, with fresh sweaty endorphins running through my system, and the inspiration of a beautiful sunrise shared with other souls who are similarly inspired, I think this is the finest place in the world, a place made just for Uncle Dave."

Software and Developement,"Scoble summarizes  the bloggers reaction to last week's announcement that Longhorn will ship without the new filesystem. My reaction, Frontier will be released in open source before the end of 2004. That gives Microsoft all of 2005 to integrate it with Windows. .
Programmers won't have any trouble figuring it out, it's designed to be  easy  for programmers. Data is persistent by default, you have to do special things to make it not persist. A little trick designed into Frontier's DNA that made all subsequent development much easier. Of course it cost some cycles back in the late 80s when the design decision was made, but nowadays the CPUs are really fast, so it proved to be a good decision.
I know Microsoft won't adopt our technology, they're not so economically rational (the employees who make the decision have a conflict, they want to keep their jobs). But what if they did? Wow"

Software and Developement,The Right Stuff
Software and Developement,"We're getting close to the open source release of Frontier. I believe it will happen before the end of September.
Technically, the software is ready to go. Andre Radke, who was the last full-time maintainer of the code at UserLand, up until four years ago, when he returned to be a full-time physics grad student, did the work to get the code ready. Steve Zellers at Apple has also been participating. I see Andre and Steve as the two leaders of the project once the release has taken place. I trust both of them, I can't imagine two better people to entrust this project to. I see myself as playing an advisory role, writing scripts to test new versions, and representing Frontier as a legal entity.
The one remaining issue to decide is the license agreement. I guess this has always been so, but now it's the crucial decision, once it's made, the release can proceed. Here's my current thinking, after having talked with several lawyers with experience in open source software, and having read up on various approaches, this is what I've come up with. (Note I am not a lawyer, I am posting this so that lawyers can comment publicly.)
1. No breakage. I want old scripts continue to run in new environments. A lot has been invested in code that runs in the Frontier environment, one of the reasons to release the kernel as source is so that those apps will run better, in more operating systems. I want to limit incentives for people to fork based on compatibility. I don't want to create a dozen semi-clones of Frontier, rather I want to incentivize people to add to the culture, add new features, fix user interface bugs, but not to break apps.
2. I want it to be possible to create a commercial business from the code base. However, I want the general rule to be that if you make an improvement to the code, you must share it on equal terms.
I think these two goals clearly imply a base license that's GPL-like, with an option for a more liberal license, for either a cash fee, or an agreement to remain compatible, or a combination of fee and agreement. This is a derivative of the MySQL license system.
I'm looking for feedback from lawyers who have experience with open source licenses, and developers who have released code under open source licenses, and people who have used code under open source licenses. The best form of feedback is in public, on a weblog, so you can  send  a URL and I can point to it. I'm not opening a comment thread on this becuase it's sure to only attract unconstructive comments.
Note that we are not trying to shake up the world, or change what anyone does, or kill anything, or necessarily even create anything. So comments that say things like ""This will never kill Apache"" or ""Python already has too much of a lead"" while quite common, always miss the point.
For an idea of why  I'm releasing Frontier as open source, please refer to this article I wrote in May."

Software and Developement,"Scoble was fascinated  how news of the Longhorn recalc propogated, but he missed the most fascinating aspect of the announcement. Microsoft shipped the story on a Friday night, I even got a detailed email from a Waggenerette, but the blogosphere waited until Monday to carry the story.
It wasn't that we were on vacation or weren't checking email over the weekend, it's just that by announcing it on Friday, Microsoft was clearly ""taking out the garbage"" (a term I learned from The West Wing). The blogosphere didn't play along. Blog flow over weekends, esp a late summer weekend, is miniscule compared to the flow on a Monday morning."
Software and Developement,"Microsoft gets something of a raw deal from the blogosphere, they're considered fair game for ridicule, when few other companies are. This should change, and I'm glad to see it is. Russ Beattie, for example, had a succinct, practical and negative  review  of Apple's new desktop computer. Bravo!
And when Adam Curry calls the iPod a platform, he's overlooking one important thing that users and developers like to see in a platform: choice of vendor. It's laughable to think that iTunes will ever work with another vendor's hardware, it's not very likely to happen, in our lifetimes, even if we live to a ripe old age. I literally did laugh when I considered the idea. That's not the way Apple works.
Postscript: Of course then I immediately realized that HP is making an iPod, just to confuse matters. Oy. There goes my theory. Does the hPod work with iTunes?"
Software and Developement,"I resolved today to catch up with Adam Curry's audio blog posts. I didn't have one of my own last night it turns out.

Toons,"Gabe:  Kara and I got ganked by four or five Horde last night out in Winterspring while we were trying to finish up a long quest chain. Thanks to everyone that showed up to help us. I'm not sure a 30 man raid was necessary, but we appreciate it."
Toons,"Gabe: People often ask me if they can come visit us at the Penny Arcade office. Some even make comments about how wonderful it must be to work in an environment like this one. I""m here to tell you this is no place you want to be. Let me show you what I see when I turn to my left."

Toons,"Tycho:  If my earlier experiences with the co-operative campaign had not endured so, there would be no question - fifteen dollars is quite simply not a value that men of reason would associate with the GRAW Map Pack.  But, drawing on that idea, let us move forward as though the powerful fraternal bonds forged in Campaign One were sufficient to assuage price related suffering to some degree.  I realize that this moves our narrative into the realm of fiction."

Toons,"Tycho: The recently conducted Xfire chat has now been collated into this easy to digest transcript. In case you wanted to digest it. In addition, the latest page of our insane Prey project has now gone online. Just click the link on the left, for ""We Have Visitors.""  Also! Your mom is trying to get a hold of you. You should give her a call.(CW)TB"
Toons,"Gabe: PAX is not the new E3. E3 failed. If someone else wants to be the new E3 they are welcome to it. They can even set up shop in the carcass of the giant and claim his power, but E3 is dead and it died for a reason. If I were them I wouldn't be in such a hurry to stuff myself in that coffin, and I certainly wouldn't boast about it."
Toons,"Gabe: I hate to do it but let""s talk about Jack Thompson for just a moment. He""s been relatively quite since our last encounter but with Bully on the horizon he""s popped up again. His recent appearance on G4 has everyone talking about him and that is exactly how Jack wants it. The man is a media whore and by putting him on television you""re just giving him what he wants. Not only that but G4 decided to put him on television with two people who are incapable of going toe to toe with him. Whatever you want to say about Jack, the guy is a lawyer and he knows how to handle himself in these sorts of debates. We all think Jack is nuts but Adam is the only person on that tape who comes off as being crazy. The guy can""t even preach to the choir for God""s sake. Mark seems like a decent guy and he stays calm but I don""t think he did any preparation for this. You can""t go up against someone like Jack and just wing it. Jack keeps is cool and essentially runs the show. G4 should have just given Jack his own half hour program. Maybe only schedule twelve re-runs of X-Play and then just slip in the Jack Thompson show."
Toons,Tycho:  Penny Arcade Armadeaddon continues - into territory more horrifying than you could possibly imagine.
Toons,Armadeaddon:  The Black Orchard
Toons,"Tycho: Finally some video of this game hits. I found the fourth one pretty frightening. Defcon is the latest game from Introversion, the ones that brought us Uplink and then Darwinia. All I've seen of it thus far was the intriguing WOPRian screenshots they had released - I've essentially only had those shots and my strong faith in the developer to keep me warm on cold nights.(CW)TB"
Toons,Gabe:
Toons,Armadeaddon: Blade Princess
Toons,"Tycho: It's ""limited,"" but not that limited. There's fifteen hundred of them total, if you are interested. (CW)TB"
Toons,"Tycho: If you'd like to submit some questions for the PAX panels next week, we won't stop you. Indeed, we might actively encourage such a thing.(CW)TB"
Toons,Gabe:
Toons,"Tycho: I just read through one of the conduits of Leipzig gaming news, and was jolted by a piece of news: Xbox Live is going to be moving into classic board games. I don't mean, like, Chutes and Ladders or some shit - though I don't doubt that GrowPot420 would snap that up on day one. No, I mean like Settlers of Catan and Carcassone. Pillars of the tabletop gaming community, so to speak. This is probably the biggest news of that convention for me. Getting people together to play these games, or finding people to play them with at all can be a trying endeavor. This is near Goddamn optimal.(CW)TB"
Toons,Tycho: There were some truly unconscionable spelling issues with the 1.0 version of that last post. I think I got them all. But I am afraid to look.(CW)TB
Toons,"Tycho:  Here is the final sequence of Armadeaddon, which you may think of as a kind of bonus stage.  The next time poor diet or exhaustion leaves us without rejoinder to infernal continuity, panel two should provide more than enough raw material."
Toons,Armadeaddon:  Epilogue
Toons,Gabe: I just wanted to give you all a quick update from PAX. Things are pretty crazy here but I thought you all might like to see a couple pictures Kiko took yesterday.
Toons,"Tycho:
The foe revealed, Armadeaddon is now almost complete.  Monday will see the promised epilogue, so at this point you have very nearly survived the ordeal.  We have endeavored these past weeks to reward the true ""enthusiast,"" that man or woman who, brow heavy, has faced such cruel abuse at our hand for the last seven years.  It is apparently our policy to honor such dedication one every decade.

Since it was announced a couple days ago, the revelation that MS would be actively courting the hardcore boardgame player is something I've thought about almost constantly.  It may be that you weren't aware there was such a thing as a hardcore player of boardgames if your last experience with the context was playing Sorry! with your sister when you were eight.  Things have progressed.

There's a million experiences in this space I could use to lure you in, but one company in particular - Days of Wonder has already decided to make electronic variants of their tabletop crack, so they occupy a twilight space between the worlds.  I hope they see an opportunity to take their (already completed!) games over to the 360, or that Microsoft offers them a locked case containing an unspecified amount of untraceable U.S. Currency, because I'd love to see this prescient move by MS turn into a new era.

Days of Wonder makes a game called Shadows Over Camelot that could quickly become a dangerous obsession, obscuring biological realities with a single-minded focus on grails.  Well, grail I guess.  There's just the one.

But it's a completely cooperative boardgame, so every player is working toward the same goals - fighting back invasions, questing, all of it.  Except there might be a traitor in the group, determined by a hidden draw, who tries to derail the effort.  He's not always there, but the potentiality of that nefarious force can create unbelievable social tension.

The gaming table's fixed coordinate in space is its asset and its obstacle - managing space and time is actually the primary challenge of any gaming group, as opposed to banishing necromancers, though that also ranks up there.  Boardgames are so rich in design that, when one of these gets dropped in front of them on Live, I think many gamers will be shocked at their sophistication.

My thumbs hurt.

(CW)TB out."
Toons,Armadeaddon: Grim Exodus
Toons,"Gabe: On10.net has posted a video interview they did with us at our office a couple weeks ago. Honestly not much real information gets conveyed. The past couple months have just been nuts for us and with PAX coming up we""re just sort of loopy. You""re welcome to watch it but please don""t expect to get anything useful out of it. Also, if you are one of the few people left who has never seen us in our true forms I""d recommend staying away from this clip. Like a child who still believes in the Easter Bunny I want you to go on thinking we look just like the cartoons for as long as you can. No one wants to find out that the Easter Bunny is actually a couple of retarded looking dorks."
Toons,"Tycho:  Just like the blistered, hungry dead, Armadeaddon itself lumbers - toward its inevitable conclusion.  There are two more installments, or perhaps I should say there is one more installment and then an epilogue. Because that is the caliber of site we operate: a site with epilogues and denouements and perhaps even the occasional finale."
Toons,Armadeaddon: Ominous Moniker
Toons,"Gabe: If you pre-registered for PAX and you have not received your pass yet, please send a mail to pax@penny-arcade.com"
Toons,"Tycho:  You can download homebrewed ROMs for the Fruit Fucker that enhance the efficiency of the feed reamer or allow you to juice via SMS.  I'd read on FFHacks.com tweaking boards that the machine had an array of sensors that had no apparent juicing purpose.  Of course, ""hackzors"" up to their spectacles in system-level code are probably the last people to read the manual."
Toons,Armadeaddon: Bitter Cup
Toons,Armadeaddon:  Flesh Harvest
Toons,"Tycho:  We'll return to those two in a moment - for now, let's get a look at our supposed protagonists.  What are they doing?  Let's find out.  Did they make any new friends?"
Toons,Gabe: The World of Warcraft CCG is just around the corner. Upper Deck is letting us premier a few of the cards I did here on the site. The first one is the Leeroy Jenkins card.
Toons,"Tycho:  We have done things in the past which were not ""for"" you, or anybody else for that matter.  That isn't what's goin' on now.  What's going on now is we are shoveling dense chunks of fanservice into the site's iron belly, and increased fervor in that chamber makes each comic bend and groan to please you."

Toons,Peer Into My Crystal Ball
Toons,"Tycho:   It has become the Saturday tradition to do the next strip upon the expo's stark and terrifying stage, but since Armadeaddon needed its proper epilogue it got moved out to Wednesday.  Gabe was highly indulgent of audience suggestions in the final version, far more than he is to me, adding many, many things based on them being called out from the microphone - he has a version with more additions still that he'll be putting up later today.  But there are things in there like the blue ball in the last panel - to say nothing of the official ""Hot-Dog Fairy"" merchandise! - that began as anecdotes and have now graduated to true PAX lore."
Toons,"Gabe: It""s taken two days but I think the nervous energy associated with PAX has finally dissipated. Hopefully those of you that attended PAX 06 will agree that the event came off pretty damn well. Obviously there were some issues with the amount of people being crammed into that space but I think we made it work. Thefinal count for PAX 2006 was 19,323 (almost 20,000 people!) and there is no doubt that we""ve outgrown the Meydenbauer center and thankfully this was the last year wewill have to deal with that. PAX 07 will be moving to the absolutely gigantic Washington State convention center in downtown Seattle. We""ll have more than triple the space and we plan on putting it to good use. I was blown away by how understanding everyone was this year. I know we had some long lines and some big crowds but I never heard anyone complain about the situation. All I heard all weekend from people was how great the show was and what a good time they were having. You guys really are awesome."

Toons,Gabe: We actually created yesterdays comic on stage at PAX. After I had finished I started doodling all over the first panel. The fans in the audience made me promise to upload this version as well as the regular comic. So here you go:

Toons,An Unseemly Grip
Toons,"Tycho:  The comic is about toes.  Also, bamboo.  Technically it's about the interaction between toes and bamboo."

Toons,Prinny Please
Toons,"Tycho:  I've read reviews that suggest Disgaea 2 basically the original Disgaea all over again -  they say that like it's a bad thing.  If you still have an appetite for Nippon Ichi's take on strategy after Disgaea, La Pucelle, Phantom Brave, and Makai Kingdom, then no force on Earth could suspend your ravenous hunger anyhow.  Every time we load it we giggle and make little hopping jumps.  Your mileage may very, especially if you have a low ceiling."

Toons,"Gabe: I don""t read game reviews. I honestly don""t see any reason to. It""s not hard to rent a game and see for yourself if it""s any good. I don""t know why I should care what number someone I don""t know and will never meet has attached to the latest game. I picked up Enchanted Arms the day it came out because I""m a fan of classic turn based RPG""s. Now there are a lot of bad games in this genre but there are also some real gems. Series like Shadow Hearts and Shin Megami Tensei are proof that the genre has grown beyond just Final Fantasy. I""m happy to say that Enchanted Arms is another of the good ones. I""ve been hooked on it since I dropped it into my 360. Robert also grabbed a copy and we have little chat sessions every morning about how awesome the game continues to be. Tycho happened to hear one of these Enchanted Arms lovefests and was actually surprised. He told us that for the most part all the reviews of the game said it""s pretty bad or at the very best only okay. I was really surprised that reviewers could have gotten this one so wrong so I hit gamerankings to see for myself. I found the Games Radar review especially bad."
Toons,Arms Aren't Even That Cool
Toons,"Tycho:  Like Chromehounds - another From Software game released to critical yawns - Enchanted Arms reviews haven't really communicated the game. I'm playing it over Gabe's shoulder, so I'm not the person to do it either.  Were I you, I might keep my eyes focused on the area directly beneath this post."
Toons,Gabe: There is some really nice HD footage from PAX available over at gametrailers.com now. They have a pretty slick behind the scenes look at how the show comes together as well as an interview with Gaybe and Tykoh from Pennies Arcadez!

Toons,"Gabe: Before PAX I mentioned that I had drawn a few cards for the World of Warcraft CCG. I posted the Leeroy Jenkins card and mentioned I had a few more. Things got crazy when PAX hit and I forgot. I remembered this morning though that I still had those cards to show you so here""s another."
Toons,"Tycho: It's available almost everywhere, actually, but we have it on our own store now if you do not already posess it. I've seen a few out there in The Retail Book Fortresses, so should you desire a copy of Epic Legends Of The Magic Sword Kings, the process will be very straightforward. I think it turned out really well, but I wrote all of it, and I get paid when you buy it. So I might not be the person to ask.  Trivia: The third book is called The Warsun Prophecies, which we already announced. The fourth book is called ""Birds Are Weird.""(CW)TB"
Toons,"Tycho:  FFXII's Gambit System is, and I am not exaggerating for effect, the mechanism by which you relinquish control of the game."
Toons,"Tycho: A crafty puzzle/platformer 1) from the first person perspective and 2) with a unique gameplay hook which is also 3) set in the Half-life Universe is more than I can handle mentally. The existing materials point toward a clinical, detached, (but most importantly) truly original sense of humor, which I guess is what happens when you hire Old Man Murray to do your writin's.Another reason I have positive associations with it are that, yeah, this team is originally from DigiPen, our local game development institute - you can check out work and games from other students here. They showed their final project to the guys at Valve, and (to hear that interview tell it) before it was even over they'd been offered jobs developing an advanced version of their concept on their in-house technology. Valve pulls directly from the community with extraordinary frequency, a philosophy so intensely moral I can hardly articulate it. Episode 2 is hitting along with Team Fortress 2 and Portal, in a single purchase, and it seems crazy that I would get all of that for twenty dollars. They haven't announced pricing yet, and I imagine that's why. I don't want to pay more than I need to, certainly, but one of the things I like about buying things directly from Valve is that I perceive it as being humane. I don't want them to kill themselves entertaining me, and if they suffer at my expense, then I at least want to compensate them fairly. (CW)TB"
Toons,"Tycho: The whole reason I wrote that other post was to link the new article about it at 1up, and I didn't even manage to do that - here you go. In a way, I'm glad I didn't link it before - in the intervening period, a new episode of the 1up show has dropped that has a ton of interview and video material for every part of Episode 2 - including TF2 and Portal. It's the top video on this page. Unbelievably delicious.(CW)TB"

Toons,A Bird Misused
Toons,"Tycho:  Positive Sony news here, at Penny Arcade?  I know, right?  We shall redouble our efforts.  The story all this was based on has been changed to say that none of it is true, or that very little of it is true (depending on who you ask), but if you're asking me I think the original story hit pretty close to the mark.  The alternative - which is to say, that xFire technology would be used for a single game and no others - suggests that their service will be another briar patch of vendor ""interpretations"" of an online community, which can't possibly be true.  I refuse to believe that, in this generation, they would leave something like this to chance."
Toons,Wiiactions
Toons,"Gabe: I sort of have a reputation for being the hot headed one here at the Arcade. I think that""s probably fair to say. I have a habit of saying very mean things to people I don""t agree with. As much as I might try not to be that guy it""s just sort of become my role."
Toons,"Tycho:  All the news about Nintendo's newest ""thiing"" is on the table, and now - with great consternation - the Internet responds.  We obtained a digital audio recorder to make recording podcasts for you a straightforward enterprise, and I think we're close, but our extended meditation on today's facts and figures was somehow devoured by the machine I have just described.  So, I'll try to remember the stuff that stood out."
Toons,Gabe:
Toons,Assume The Worst
Toons,"Tycho:  We were getting our hands on a four gig CompactFlash for the podcast recorder when the ""friendly staff"" gave us an idea for a new comic.  Thank you, friendly staff!  May nothing ever happen to your... staff."
Toons,"Gabe: So I picked up my MacBook Pro a few months back and I would not call myself a convert but I do really like it. I""ve been doing all the basic iLife stuff, like making DVD""s of Gabe""s birthday party and photocasting pictures to the family. I am getting much more comfortable with the Mac but there are still some things I don""t quite understand and so I have a couple questions for you guys."
Toons,"Tycho:  Mario Hoops 3-on-3 is impressive in many ways, as I've suggested: certainly as a technical showcase, it's nice to have in your bag.  As a catalogue of Japanese aggression toward gamers, it's clear now that future generations will refer to these advanced cups as a deeply scandalous exhibit.  I have seen a Goddamn ninja weave a dark circle, disappear with a burst of leaves in some strictly Hattori Hanzo type shit, and then phase back into the physical plane to haunt our mortal hoops."
Toons,In Breach Of Warranty
Toons,"Tycho: There's a game that will be downloadable on the PS3 called ""Flow"" or ""flOw"" which I read about over at Kotaku, and in the comment thread discussing it a user threw out the links to a version playable online - it's pretty interesting. You can click that link to play it, and you can also head over here (highly recommended) to delve into the philosophy behind it. I think you'll be intrigued.(CW)TB"
Toons,Eastern Delights
Toons,"Tycho:  Otherwise engaged on Wednesday, Tokyo had a head start on us - its powerful newsings daring to accrue, even as we were being sodomized at the border crossing.  Much of this content was indecipherable.  But we can still point and shriek, like when a monolith descends."
Toons,"Tycho:  Stop whatever you're doing right now and watch this video - offered in HD for Windows Media or Quicktime.  That's Level 5's White Knight Story, and I must stress for readers that Level 5 is in no way fucking around.  That's how you sell us a Goddamn Playstation 3.  We are almost impervious to many of the brands that define Sony's hardware:  for us, Metal Gear Solid and Gran Turismo emit no will crushing pheromones.  Compare that to the White Knight clip, which is a fairly comprehensive tour of my private desires."
Toons,The Secret Weapon
Toons,"Gabe: So I am the big two nine today. I guess I have one more year of youthful indiscretion before old age is upon me. It seems like birthdays are a good time for reflection and so I hope you""ll forgive me if this is a little mushy."

Toons,Gabe: I had some free time today and I thought about how long it had been since I did some good old fashioned fan art. So I thought about what games I am most excited for and then I sat down and whipped this up.
Toons,"Gabe: So I decided to bring back gabeart. For right now I""m using Blogger.com but eventually I should be able to get it integrated into PA."
Toons,Mysteries Of The Deep
Toons,"Tycho:  Gabe was instructed to find and subsequently purchase the new Little Mermaid title for Kara, whose enthusiasm for teenaged fish has not abated since the film's release in nineteen-eighty-nine.  I had the opportunity to hear him call no less than twelve places yesterday in search of the product, each time with a voice carefully modulated to insist that he had absolutely no interest in such a thing.  There was less and less Gabriel left with each inquiry, until finally he was making the calls via the speakerphone, sprawled out on the floor."

The episode is available for direct download at this link, or feel free to subscribe to our iTunes compatible feed here.  We have not settled on a schedule, rather, we've just begun leaving the recorder on every time we write.  It's different:  people can actually just walk in, and without their knowledge they've become a part of the ""show.""  It may become more standardized as we refine our process, but I know better than to make promises on this score.  I hope you enjoy it, it's been gone a lot longer than we intended.  This helpful guide should help you get the most out of it."
Toons,Censorship Made Easy
Toons,"Tycho:  When I started reading articles about Senator Brownback's bill - the one that would require that the ESRB play through games in their entirety - I expected to agree with it in principle, but take issue with its execution.  The shrill phase of the site, where I would don armor and ride under the aegis of the true gamer no matter how mild the incentive, now rests in the reliquary with Xbox Controller Jokes and Jabs At User Friendly.  I had chosen a singularly poor moment to become reasonable.  Upon further examination, the Senator's plan (which I think may be rightly called a machination) is the sort of thing one might forge in the fires of Mount Doom."
Toons,"Gabe: Our latest Podcast went up over the weekend. I figured many of you probably missed it, so here's Tycho's post from Saturday."
Toons,"Tycho:  1:25 - When we say ""This shit about the Zune,"" the revelation that caused all the hubbub was from Zunester - one of these MS  insider blogs (like Zune Insider or Gamerscore).  David Caulton, the man who runs the Zunester blog, wades into the comments and is as frank as he can possibly be with the people who comment there.  I recognize that people are working hard on it.  In the future, I hope that their hard work and my requirements for a device of this kind will converge."
Toons,"Tycho:  Poking around at the 'Avatar yesterday, hungry for news, we came across a link to Engadget's verdict on the Zune.  At least, the Zune as it is currently conceived - before the animal hunger and ingenuity of the open-source community penetrates it.  I got the impression that Engadget was as surprised as we were to find a lot of the gadget's potential - things that seemed natural to expect, seeing as they are currently made manifest by competing devices - was sort of missing in action."

Toons,Imprecision (As It Relates To Erotica)
Toons,"Tycho: Gabriel apparently holds these... ""films"" to very high standards indeed. I imagine he's routinely disappointed by the genre."
Toons,"Gabe: You might notice that in Today""s comic Tycho is reading Bloodlines. We both just wrapped the book up and it""s incredible. I""ve always been a huge Boba Fett fan and now thanks to Karen Traviss I know why."
Toons,"Tycho:  Gears multi had just become a nightly fixture, and then - wholly without warning - it was over.  A pack of downloadable maps (already in progress?) might give us another night or two on Sera, but the reality is that the rest of Team Inferno has moved on to Rainbow Six."
Toons,A Word Of Thanks
Toons,Gabe: Penny Arcade turned eight years old today. Happy birthday to us!
Toons,"Gabe: The Child""s Play website has been updated with more events taking place all over the country. If you would like to set something up in your neck of the woods please send a mail over to Kristen. I""m not sure if I""ve mentioned it here already but Kristen is actually in charge of Child""s Play this year. IF you""ve attended PAX you know her better as Princess Red Dot. She""s the voice on the loud speaker and the official Mom of the show. She actually did an interview with Fleen a couple weeks ago. If you missed it you can see it here."
Toons,Maximum Moisture
Toons,"Tycho:  It was good news there for a little while, when PS1 games were five bucks a pop and you were changin' out that hard drive and still retaining your warranty - big, generous moves that asked hard questions of their primary competitor.  Just days later, it's weird rumor after dark rumbling after grim report."
Toons,"Tycho:  We are mentioned briefly in the most recent Major Nelson Radio podcast, where we learn that the man apparently can't remember which one of us is which, even though he stood before us in our marble reception hall only days earlier.  The end of the same podcast features an interview with one Chip Lang, Vice President of Online Commerce for Electronic Arts.  The good Major keeps it social, and does not savage his guest, presumably because he likes his job and would like to keep it Never fear! We can do what he can't."
Toons,Reading Between The Lines
Toons,"Gabe: I wanted to mention all our Child""s Play auctions again just to make sure everyone is aware of them."
Toons,"Gabe: I took the Wii home over the weekend and was able to put quite a bit of time into Zelda. There was what I would describe as a bru ha ha over at Joystiq when one of their bloggers claimed the game was a flop. He cited its terrible graphics as reason enough to dismiss it entirely. The response in the thread afterwards was heated with lots of people claiming that the graphics weren""t as bad as he claimed and that the game actually looked really good. Having played it all weekend I""m here to tell you that""s not the correct response."
Toons,"Tycho:  I'm super depressed.  I thought I had invented a new word - mirthquake - and then I was going to say that you should prepare yourselves for the aforementioned, as today's comic strip was rated this or that number on the rictus scale.  I mean seriously, I've been excited all weekend.  A simple Google search put me in my place - the word is practically ubiquitous.  Expect it soon on Urban Dictionary, that mausoleum of once vibrant language."
Toons,You Know It To Be True
Toons,"Gabe: Lots of people asked for a wallpaper sized version of the birds are Weird book cover. I get so many requests for different crazy resolutions that it""s not really worth it. So here""s a big high res image for you guys. You might have to do some tweaking but you should be able to make something passable out of it no matter your resolution. Click on the thumbnail for the big one."
Toons,"Tycho:
Do not forget!  All the information can be found at yonder page.  As requested, the date has been bumped up to the December 15th to give people more time for their projects.

The patch delivered a day or two ago makes the final game much, much easier to recommend.

Toons,"Gabe: I""ve got some Child""s Play auctions to tell you guys about. Keep in mind that 100% of the proceeds from all these auctions will go directly to the kids."
Toons,"Tycho:  Gabriel had to take me aside yesterday, on account of my generally unkind behavior toward our opponents.  I'm not even aware I'm doing it.  His position appears to be that, and certainly I don't want to put words in his mouth, but the implication is that I am allowed to chainsaw a person in half, but the ostentatious post-match sort of ""end-zone boogie"" phase is not entirely necessary."
Toons,Meet Mr. Hyde
Toons,"Gabe: If you""re going out to pick up Gears today (who isn""t?) and you pick up the collectors edition you""ll get a fancy art book. I""ve been told that the Gears fan artwork I did was so well received by the developers that they actually included it at the last minute in the book. I haven""t seen it for myself yet but I""m really excited to go pick it up today. If you missed it, this was the piece I did."
Toons,"Tycho:  I've been wondering what would happen to Gears of War once people could actually play it.  Would it survive the transition from the realm of eternal potential into our genuine world, where things are saddled with, well, reality?  What if it's only a great game, well executed, but does not usher in an age of prosperity and consequence-free sexual abandon?"

Toons,"Gabe: The mood in the office this morning is somewhat tense. We all spent the weekend playing FFXII and we came back today completely divided regarding its quality. I have to admit that after putting in nearly fifteen hours over the past two days I""m prepared to call it the best FF game I""ve ever played. I know that""s at odds with what I said on Friday but it""s the truth. Tycho and Robert are actually playing together and they""re at about the five hour mark. They came in this morning saying the game was trash and I can""t blame them. They""re knee deep in what I""d describe as the tutorial phase of the game. If you played Kingdom Hearts II you""ll remember that""s a game that doesn""t actually start until nearly eight hours in. I don""t mean like you don""t start having fun until then, I mean you literally don""t even see the title screen until you""ve dicked around with Roxas for eight fucking hours. FFXII felt the same way to me. It""s extremely slow to start but now I""m having a hard time putting the controller down."

Toons,"Tycho:  The Turkey Trilogy is a thrilling, three-part story that only deals with turkey one time - and even then, it does so in a non-committal fashion.  The narrative is really not focused on roasted birds.  I hoe you will be able to overlook this shortcoming, and enjoy those parts which are tangential to heritage fowl."

Also, a few new auction items have been reeled in for the Charity Dinner:

On the other hand, the grandma and the greasy fireman are only too real.  I sometimes wish that the fireman were less real, particularly when I am sent to the basement on an errand."
Toons,"Gabe: Joystiq had some interesting articles up over the weekend about introducing your family to the Wii. I actually had a similar experience. We had a house full of friends and family for Thanksgiving and the Wii was really the star of the show. Kara and I both had parents over and we actually had a hard time getting them off of Wii sports. I can""t even count how many rounds of bowling I must have played. It was amazing to watch how easily they picked it up and how much fun they had. What was great was watching Kara""s Dad who loves to bowl but can""t anymore because of his knees. I wouldn""t be surprised if he goes home this week and tries to pick one up."
Toons,"Gabe: So the big news today, in the world of web comics at least is that PvP is getting itself animated. Scott posted the news along with a little teaser over on his site. He""s actually writing the entire thing with the help of Kris Straub. I was a big fan of the old Blamimations they did together and I""ve told them both whenever possible that they needed to collaborate more. I make jokes when I""m uncomfortable and it just so happens I have issues with anxiety so I""m essentially uncomfortable all day. That means I spend a lot of my time making jokes. When Scott and Kris were up here visiting I hardly said a word. They""re just too funny and they""re always on. You just can""t compete with them, all you can do is laugh."
Toons,"Gabe: We did a really awesome project (can I say it""s awesome, is that okay?) for Wired magazine. You can either go pick up the most recent issue and read it there or check it out on their site. They asked us to do a piece for them handicapping all three of the next generation systems.

Trust me when I tell you that anything, no matter what itis will be very much appreciated by these hospitals. Don't think thatjust becasue you can't get the kids a PS3 you can't help. Some simplethings like Playdough actually need to be thrown away after each use.Certain items that the kids like to play with collect germs and canonly be used once. They can never have too many containers of thestuff. Or too many batteries for that matter. Or coloring books ormarkers.

In Spokane, there would be gravel out and other public safety measures, but when snow falls over on this side of the state people don't see it as weather, it's seen as a portent - evidence of an angry pantheon. A single snowflake will fall on their windshield, and they will immediately swerve their SUV into a truck hauling fuel. Faced with miles of ice and idiots between his home and work (and a reported eight hour commute), Gabe chose to hole up in Fort Krahulik, which means no tablet and no scanner.

Toons,It Is A Sensitive Topic
Toons,"Tycho:  I told Gabriel a Joystiq operative had played Mario Party 8 in Japan recently.  Much of the entry is given over to an exhaustive description of Hotel Chan-Chan, a ""love house"" where the author spent his time (and, apparently, several thousand dollars). But in the slender margins of that erotic journal we do get an idea what the Wii could mean to the franchise."
Toons,"Tycho: There are two things I must mention.First, Gabriel liked the cover for book four (entitled ""Birds Are Weird"") so much that he wanted to make a poster of it, and it's not worth arguing with him when he gets like that so we let him do it. It is, even now, awailable!Also: PAX preregistration opens today, and since we've had a couple of these now you probably know if it's something you'd like to attend. You save ten dollars over the door price, which is, like, ten bucks. This is money you could put toward some other purpose!(CW)TB"
Toons,"Tycho:  I uploaded the comic early, as many of you noticed.  I entered the wrong number in the update field.  You may also have noticed that the spelling in these posts has really gone to hell.  So, that's numbers and letters.  I hope to one day discover a set of pictograms with which I can manage some baseline fucking proficiency."
Toons,The Federal Bureau of Taking All Your Shit
Toons,Gabe: I mentioned the Nerdcore Rising documentary a few weeks ago and I know a lot of you were interested in it. Well the girls doing it have decided to help build interest in the film by highlighting one of the many nerds they met on their journey each week. They call it the Nerd of the Week and the first Nerd is actually PAX. I'll go ahead and plug the Youtube version in right here so you all can check it out. I think they did a fucking incredible job cutting this together.
Toons,"Tycho:  Gabe keeps coming into the Goddamn office with his Goddamn tales of high adventure, telling me about how there's tokens or some shit in Burning Crusade now, or maybe tiers, and other words I had scoured from my consciousness.  He also says there is hot new five-man content, which initially sounded like pornography.  The comic is correct - I purchased it in a moment of weakness.  As I must often approach you, the cherished reader, to apologize for this or that indiscretion, it may be more appropriate to say that I have moments of strength which are suspended in cowardice and moral decay."
Toons,"The Hook, The Line, And The Sinker"
Toons,"Gabe: I know Child""s Play is over but we had a few items here at the office that we didn""t get auctioned off earlier. So if you""re still feeling generous here are a couple cool auctions to check out."
Toons,"Gabe: Well I""m back from Hawaii and feeling pretty damn good. Kara and I realized a few months ago that we""d never really taken a proper vacation. We go down to the Oregon coast every summer but that""s just a few hours away and even in the summer the beach there can be pretty cold. Other than that the only time we travel anyplace is for a convention and those can hardly be considered vacations. So we decided it was time to go someplace warm and relaxing for a change and so we spent five days on Maui."
Toons,"Tycho: And so, our own pilgrimage comes to a close.  Thank you!  I think we all had fun.  I should stress that ""we"" refers to your cruel hosts, Gabriel and myself, who over the last eight years have tormented you thus with such dedication and enthusiasm."

Toons,"Tycho:  Nintendo of America president Reggie Fils-Aime cuts an imposing figure.  Forum denizens are routinely shocked by the adulation this man receives, but if you have ever seen him, it isn't especially shocking.  He seems to project beyond himself, exerting a kind of Reggie Field that dogs and many birds find unpleasant.  Hearing a man speak with this much drive and confidence about an imaginary plumber is sort of enthralling."

Toons,"Tycho: The demo they just put on Live is pretty short, and it is set in Mexico, a venue that was already questionable when they plowed it up again for Rainbow Six: Vegas.  R6:V's cover implementation was a revelation, and I think we were also hoping to see GRAW graduate to something a little more fluid - but what do you do?  R6 doesn't have the natural terrain, and it doesn't have the reconnaissance features and other field ordnance options. People are already wondering what separates these two franchises nowadays, and I could provide a comprehensive analysis, but as much as it might rile the hardcore I think standardizing some elements of the interface could be great for both games."

I would like some crazy shit to happen when I minimize something don't get me wrong.  I want my windows to go Waja-wajow(!) is possible.  But if there's a great reason to ""trade horses midstream"" or whatever the going metaphor is I haven't discovered it."

I mean the real deal table in the basement shake hand or pen grip forehand loop Table Tennis. In talking to some of our friends around here we discovered that our love of the sport is not unique. If you live in Seattle or you came to PAX you should know about Pink Godzilla. They run an import game store downtown and they also happen to have their own internal Ping Pong ladder. When they found out we had our own ladder they immediately began the shit talking. A challenge was issued and the match went down last Friday."

I sometimes worry about appearing partisan in these communiques, but it is not my job to be fair.  I'm not a journalist, I'm a consumer.  I don't buy one product from each company in the interests of some karmic ideal, and I don't need to purge my posts of wrongthink because I haven't produced something suitable for use as a press release.

Toons,"Tycho:  Alas, high Olympus!  Would that we had known thee better."
Toons,"Gabe: Yesterday I made a post about the teenagers that murdered the homeless guy and then blamed it on violent games. These kids have given the media their angle and just like all the other cases where games are mentioned no one will ever look any further. No one will ask what their family life was like, what their parents were like, what the kid was like before all this happened. Games did it and that""s the end of the story."
Toons,"Tycho:  Illusionz was too far away to enjoy often, and even if we had made it out there our twenty bucks - administered biweekly - wasn't going to save the place.  An imposing acre-wide indoor cavern, its unchanging arcade selection came to resemble a kind of mausoleum - still inside, with the heroes of another era laid 'round."
Toons,"The Home Of The Gods, Part One"
Toons,"Gabe: You might have seen this story on CNN about the teens that murdered a homeless guy and then equated it to the sort of thrill one might get from a violent video game. There will be plenty of articles focusing on these kids and their crime. I""d like to take a second and talk about the parents of these teenagers instead. It is the job of a parent to teach their children certain rules. Obviously the rules themselves and the emphasis each family places on them will vary, but there are certain universal constants that these parents obviously failed to pass on."

Toons,Gabe: Well we had ourping pongmatch with Sucker Punch last Friday and I must say things did not go well for us. The Sucker Punch Rockets lived up to their studio's name and left us with a big old purple shiner. Already there is talk here in the office that our glorious victory march through the game industry is now looking more like a trail of tears.

They""ve done tons of work for comics and games but we actually met them because of their work on UFS.

Toons,"Tycho:  Gabriel and I played Starcraft, everyone played Starcraft, but for the most part he and I would play two Terran armies against Zerg computer opponents in an effort to simulate Starship Troopers.  It might sound like you could only get a couple nights of entertainment out of this scenario, but you'd be underestimating our feelings toward Starships and the proud Troopers that wait within."

Toons,The Rising Cost Of Rock
Toons,"Tycho:  The aggregate price for all Rock Band peripherals was originally three hundred dollars, going by the vague entries in the Gamespot database, but those strange figures are really the chicken entrails of the gaming industry - its powers of prophecy are somewhat in question."
Toons,"Gabe: A few eagle eyed viewers noticed that I accidentally drew a Nebulon-B frigate in today's comic. Gabe mentions the Mon Calamari and the Corellians but the Nebulon-B is actually produced by the Kuat Drive Yards.I deeply regret the mistake and I have since corrected it in the comic by replacing the original drawing with one of the Mon Calamari Cruiser ""Liberty"", sadly lost in the Battle of Endor . I am in no way trying to diminish the Nebulon-B frigate or the fine craftsmanship of the dedicated workers employed by KDY. Again I apologize for any inconvenience or offence my carelessness may have caused.  -Gabe out"
Toons,"Tycho:  I have no time for Lair, I'm afraid.  My limited playtime with the game has only encouraged me to further limit said playtime, throttling this value until it reaches zero.  As one of the long-known exclusives, a kind of cult has formed around the game - one whose creed hinges on the glorious arrival of their reptile saint.  It is a weird hunger, one quite outside reality, and it would be best to manage those expectations before their piss-smelling vagrant messiah stumbles into the retail channel."

If you'd like to hurl yourself into the running, please do so at your earliest convenience. This year's Omega Prize differs substantially from our offerings in the past.

Toons,"Tycho:  Even now, the metamorphosis has begun - common Crackdown disks are starting to spin, and splinter, and light is coming out. The gates have swung wide, and now you may know what we know. In this comic scenario, I am the man being obliterated by his friend and Kiko is the one behind the red lance of energy.  I wanted to be angry, but it was simply too awesome."
Toons,"Gabe: I""d like to apologize to one of the teams we played last night in Halo 3. Sadly today""s comic really isn""t too far from the truth. Halo has some strange power that makes me really want to talk shit. I honestly don""t endorse that sort of behavior in any of the other games I play. Also, I""m used to playing Rainbow 6 where voice communication is limited to your own team. So I feel bad because last night I was defending our flag against a team of penny arcade fans who honestly seemed like a good bunch of guys. However after being put down by one of them a couple times I finally got the jump on him and as his body hit the ground I said something to the effect of go fuck yourself. And also I think I made a spitting noise."

The word is out, now, and there isn't much consensus on whether their ""Elite/Free Play"" tiers represent a reasonable value.

Toons,"Gabe:
There""s a good chance you""ll see some news about Ron Gilbert working on our game popping up today. I believe a press release has gone out to all the major game news type places. The press release covers all the basics about how Ron is a pioneer in the adventure game genre and how he was the co-creator of the Monkey Island series. I just wanted to share a quick personal note about the story.

We had our first meeting with Ron pretty early in the design process. Tycho and I were getting the story fleshed out and we had some ideas about the design and over all pace of the game. We laid it all out for Ron and then he picked up a whiteboard marker and started teaching class. I""m not sure how many people can say they got a game design 101 course taught by Ron Gilbert, but that""s exactly what Tycho and I got that day. His insights into the way you move the player through an interactive story so that they get to explore the world but don""t loose the narrative were incredible. He was drawing diagrams and helping us really visualize the game in a way that had never even occurred to us. We""re ridiculously lucky to have him on board and helping us with Onthe Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness: Episode One.

You""ll actually be getting another pretty in-depth look at the game towards the end of this month. I can""t really give anymore details right now but I think most people will be pleasantly surprised with the progress. In the meantime here""s another bit of concept art. This was drawn by me and colored by Imaginary friends studios.

Toons,"Gabe:  So the latest PC gamer should be arriving on news stands any day now if it hasn't already. This particular issue has a very early look at our game, On The Rain-Slick Precipice of Darkness: Episode One. They actually sent one of their guys (Dan Stapleton) up to Canada to visit Hothead and get a first hand look at the game in development. Dan apparently liked what he saw because the resulting article is actually really positive."
Toons,"Tycho:  We attended the same Nintendo Media Summit you have seen reported elsewhere, in the hopes of seeing Super Mario Galaxy or Metroid Prime 3: Corruption - titles which are not minigame compilations, portable puzzle games, or games for my mom.  I don't want to say that the complimentary breakfast and lunch were a factor.  Let me say that we were hungry when we made the decision to go."
Toons,"Gabe:
-Gabe out"
Toons,"Tycho: This thing is pretty huge. I don't mean in terms of kilobytes - I mean it's packed tight with powerful features. Upscaling of content has been in demand, and it's been delivered. Like the 360 Elite, you need to be hooked up via a managed connection (i.e., HDMI) to upscale a DVD. Past that, it will knock up your old PS/PS2 games to 1080p, but the results we've gotten here haven't been supernatural - still appreciated, though.The real flavor is elsewhere: specifically, the ability to stream video, pictures, and music from ""a DLNA compliant device,"" which you'll find just about every computer already is. That's only half of it. The Remote Play option of the PSP (the one that lets you enjoy certain types of content stored on your PS3 via your PSP) is deeply enriched by this capacity. You can do this much already. But with the next update for the Playstation Portable - 3.50, to be released before the end of the month - you'll be able to access your PS3 remotely via any wireless connection. I must say, starting a download at home while I'm still at the office sounds pretty Goddamn good. Also, while we are loving the PSP, am I the only person enthralled by the idea of R-Type Tactics?

Toons,"Gabe: It's hard to believe but we're really only a couple months away from PAX 2007. We'll actually be choosing our 20 Omeganaughts on the 15th of this month. That's this week so if you want a shot at being in the Omegathon, you need to register for the show by this Friday. As usual Omeganaughts should expect to have all their gaming skills put to the ultimate test in a three day no holds barred battle Royal cage match. Well we don't have a cage, no one has to fight in a cage. All the other stuff is true though. The gamer that manages to survive will be rewarded with a trip for two to the Tokyo Game Show and $5,000 is spending money. Not bad for three days work. I know it sounds silly but Surf's Up is actually a really fun game. I know it's supposed to be for kids but we picked it up last week and had a blast with it here in the office. It's sort of like Mario Kart meets Tony Hawk on the ocean...with penguins. You have this super fun track out on the ocean with crazy jumps, rails to grind and obstacles. The entire time your trying to navigate this track a massive wave is devouring it. So your racing your opponents and the wave and trying to do tricks all at the same time. I don't know if it sounds as good when I explain it. It's just a really fun game and I recommend you find a way to give it a try. The game actually came with a ticket for the movie so we took Gabe to see it this weekend. I highly recommend the film as well. We sawShrek 3 recently and that felt like a bunch of voice actors and animators collecting a paycheck. It was one of the dullest movies I've ever seen. Surf's up on the other hand was a blast. Visually it was a real stunner and packed with absolutely beautiful animation. It was also crazy funny. Sometimes when you watch an animated movie it feels like all the actors sat in a room by themselves and recorded all their lines independently of one another. In Surf's Up it felt like all the actors were in the same room and they all had a script but it wasn't a big deal. They were all improvising and playing off each other. I haven't laughed that hard at an animated movie since Ice Age. If you have kids don't miss it and if you don't have kids grab the DVD when it drops.-Gabe out"

Toons,"Tycho:  We grabbed a couple demos yesterday afternoon to see if we were missing anything, specifically Tenchu Z and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End, and came away with the expected comic materials.  I think Tenchu Z may get explored in a more robust fashion in Monday's strip, but after the loading is complete the demo flashes up one of those screens that is completely grown over with control instructions.  It wasn't even an especially bad one, and there are very, very bad ones, like the one in the demo for StarFire Saga V: Laserion.  It was merely an assault on the mind, paralyzing in its way."
Toons,"Tycho: Keek directed me to a radical (and potentially even ""badical"") article on BioShock over at Gamers Wif Jobs. I've been wondering about the recent PR shift the game has gone through, because I don't just keep hearing that it is a ""shooter first,"" but I keep hearing specifically that it is a ""kick-ass shooter,"" even though it's a game where you learn about Objectivism underwater while helping jealous composers get revenge. I've never doubted that the game will be great, by whatever road it reaches that greatness. The recent WWE slant just had me curious about whether I'll be able to perform a suplex in-game. You may not think that is important, but it is totally important.(CW)TB"
Toons,Gabe: Obviously there's a lot of you guys out there. A few million easy. I try very hard not to use the site for evil but occasionally I can't help it. This is one of those times. On June 29th the iPhone drops. I know I know it's only 2G but let's all just agree that I'm a gadget whore and move on. I've spoken to a couple people at Cingular stores and what I'm hearing is that I have a better chance of giving birth this month than of getting my hands on one of these phones. So I'm turning to you. I'm not asking you to kill or riot (yet). I just need to know what I should do if I really want to buy one of these on the 29th. I could also use some help obtaining a Beautifly. I understand I need a Wurmple to evolve into a Silcoon. However that takes place at level 7 from what I understand and I can't seem to find a Wurmple lower than 10 or 11. I thought I might need to breed a baby Wurmple but then I still run the risk of it evolving into a Cascoon rather than a Silcoon. Am I on the right track with the breeding idea and if so is there anything I can do to ensure I get a Silcoon? Also I am a huge pussy. -Gabe out
Toons,"Tycho:  There are more substantive (read: impenetrable) tabletop wargames, but you can have a lot of fun with Clix if you are able to stop buying them long enough to actually play.  Halo ActionClix have been announced for awhile, but when we sat down to write the strip yesterday we were looking over some pics of the final models and felt confident that we had discovered today's topic."

Toons,"Tycho:  The comic started out as a style guide for forums, similar to the recent style guide for gaming journalists - but while we were looking over the Lair boards at GameFAQs, we found that material already in place there was deluxe in every respect.

Toons,"Tycho:  It hasn't become official policy, yet.  But with Gabriel's afternoon whiled away with kids' movie tie-in title Surf's Up - followed by a raucous Pokemon Tournament that saw his Monferno victorious - well, it would be easy to come away with that impression.  It's a dangerous genre, games for young people, as it's practically defined by cramped budgets and shoehorned licenses.  It is also much more unassuming, much lighter fare, and doesn't delight in abusing the player as more ""sophisticated"" games do.  I suppose that has its own appeal."

Toons,"Tycho: When I'm on the fence about advertising a game, I just don't do it - but this is a case where the fence I was on had another fence on top of it, and I was sitting on that one.Essentially, I'm not sure if we want to advertise for Casinos. Actually, I'm fairly certain we don't. But Skill City isn't a Casino exactly, since it's not based on games of chance, though it does allow you to play games similar to Tetris or Puzzle Fighter or Bookworm for money. You don't have to - you can also play their games for free, or for the game's internal currency. In any case, I turned down the ads - but at the same time it seems like the sort of thing some readers may be interested in. I imagine that as time passes, we'll see more original games like Antskrieg hit the service, but for now there are many familiar faces. (CW)TB"

Toons,"Tycho:  Months after it was necessary, Sony has thrown their blogging hat into the ring...  of blogging.  I've heard people compare it to Larry Hryb/Major Nelson's blog, but with a rotating ""crew"" of bloggers - like a public relations version of the Wu Tang Clan - it's more like Microsoft's Gamerscore blog.  Which, coincidentally, I never read because it is run by a rotating ""crew"" of bloggers, like a public relations version of the etcetera etcetera.  The mental image is that of a corporate hydra, the brand seared and scabbed upon its breast."

Toons,"Tycho:  Ever since I closed the lid of my DS, sealing the Pokemon within and stunting their development, I have been expelled from polite society.  I think Gabriel might have imagined that we would engage in furious battles during Recess, out on the Big Toy, until the bell rang for lunch.  For a time, I hoped to take on a coaching role for other players, wise with my years (or perhaps weeks) of Pokemon husbandry - but Gabriel exclaimed that ""a Pokemon trainer's strength comes from within,"" which I assume means not from me.  Through some strange reversal of polarity, I am being ostracized for not befriending electric mice.  It is a world dipped - perhaps even double dipped - in madness."

Or reduced it, at any rate. It's an unbelievable value, etc. (CW)TB"
Toons,"Tycho:  There's a new Alternate Reality Game spinning up for Halo 3, God Damn them - God Damn them to hell.  I know perfectly well that I am being subjugated by a sophisticated marketing effort, that the best one can accomplish in these games is to get a real good look at the teeth before the mouth closes around you.  I type this even as the rabbit holes stand open in two other windows.  I don't presume to speak for the entire species, but there is something about secrets that does bit the mind."

Toons,"Tycho:  Gabriel and Kara are thinking about moving, but only one of them is approaching things with the correct amount of dread.  It is almost impossible to find a home these days which is not some unholy conduit - a winking anus of evil that acts as a revolving door for hell's starveling dead.  But a hollowed-out ghoul in shredded wedding gown doesn't need to be a dealbreaker.  Don't let a sundered soul turn your dream home into a nightmare charnel house!"

They suggest that gamers may find inspiration in their ""iconic shape,"" by which I assume they mean ""a triangle."" These ""Chip Lords"" can't even be bothered to make their own commercials anymore. They have heard about the YouTube MySpaces, and they want to get an oily tendril around participation culture."

Toons,"Tycho:  The memories of those who came of age in the eighties have become a kind of ghastly rummage sale, a tilled up cemetery where icons lay tilted over bones draped in ancient finery.  Pork caught a preview of Transformers on Monday, and he claims that it is not, in fact, heresy - but I don't know how calibrated our respective tastes are.  I was going to make a statement about how any constantly shifting image could entertain him, enthrall him, command him, until I realized that this viewing was late at night, in the twilight period we call Pork After Hours, when his medication wanes and his blood is frenzied by some dark moon.  For him to have focused on anything at any time after nine o'clock is actually high praise."
